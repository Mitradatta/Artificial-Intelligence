## Introduction:


## What is Mini-Max Algorithm and How does it work ?
Mini-Max algorithm is a **Recursive Bactracking Algorithm**, which makes optimal decision for current state based on each of its possible successor states.
It is generally used in 2-player based games such as TicTacToe, Backgammon, Chess, and Mancala etc which are played in turn-based. One of the palyer is **Minimizer**  and other player is **Maximizer**.

**Minimizer**:Minimizer or **MIN** player is a player, who always tries to minimize the opponents score.

**Maximizer**:Maximizer or **MAX** player is a player, who always tries to get maximium score possible.
