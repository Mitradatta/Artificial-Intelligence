## Introduction:



## What is Mini-Max Algorithm and How does it work ?
Mini-Max algorithm is a **Recursive Bactracking Algorithm**, which makes optimal decision for current state based on each of its possible successor states.
It is generally used in 2-player based games such as TicTacToe, Backgammon, Chess, and Mancala etc which are played in turn-based. In general the result or **Terminal** state of these games is either **"Win"** or **"Lose"** or **"Draw"** .One of the palyer is called as **Minimizer** and other player is called as **Maximizer**.

**Minimizer**:Minimizer or **MIN** player is a player, who always tries to minimize the opponents score.

**Maximizer**:Maximizer or **MAX** player is a player, who always tries to get maximium score possible.


## Understanding the Algorithm
```
print("Hello Wolrd")

```

## How to Run the Code?

This repository contains two source code files

- **start.java**: This file contains the code that displays the first page, where you can select which player can start the game i.e either **Player** or **Computer**


- **TicTacToe.java**:This file contains the various functions that are a part of computing **minimax** value in each state of the game. 

Download both the files including images and run the file  **start.java**
